# GAIA-F Design

GAIA-F (Genetic Algorithm Intelligence Architecture - Framework) is a Spring Boot application that applies evolutionary computation principles to discover patterns and generate predictions from time-series data. The system is designed for financial analysis, scientific research, and any domain requiring algorithmic discovery from sequential data.

## Business Problem and Solution

### Problem Statement
Traditional approaches to time-series analysis rely on predetermined mathematical models or statistical techniques. These methods often fail to capture complex, non-linear patterns or adapt to changing data characteristics over time. GAIA-F addresses this limitation by evolving custom algorithms that automatically discover optimal processing strategies for specific datasets.

### Solution Approach
GAIA-F models mathematical algorithms as digital "organisms" that evolve through genetic programming techniques. These organisms compete to process time-series data most effectively, with successful traits being passed to subsequent generations through simulated breeding and mutation processes.

## Core Concepts

### Biological Metaphor
The system draws inspiration from biological evolution:

- **Organisms** represent complete algorithms for processing time-series data
- **Chromosomes** are parallel processing pathways within each organism
- **Genes** are individual mathematical operations (addition, multiplication, trigonometric functions)
- **Evolution** occurs through breeding successful organisms and mutating their genetic material
- **Natural Selection** favors organisms that produce better predictions or more useful data transformations

### Data Processing Philosophy
Time-series data flows through the system as discrete "DataQuanta" - snapshots of data at specific time points. As each DataQuantum passes through an organism, it accumulates computed values from all genetic operations, creating an enriched dataset with both original and derived information.

## System Components

### Data Layer - Time Series Processing

**DataQuantum Structure**
Each DataQuantum represents a moment in time within a time-series dataset:
- Contains original data points (e.g., stock prices: open, high, low, close)
- Accumulates computed results from genetic operations
- Maintains traceability of which Gene created each computed value
- Supports safe indexing with modulo arithmetic to prevent array bounds errors

**Use Case Examples:**
- **Financial Data**: Daily stock prices with computed technical indicators
- **Scientific Data**: Sensor readings with derived statistical measures
- **Economic Data**: Market indicators with predictive transformations

### Genetic Programming Layer

**Gene Types and Operations**
The system includes basic mathematical operations that can be combined in complex ways:

**Arithmetic Genes:**
- **Addition/Subtraction**: Trend adjustment and offset calculations
- **Multiplication/Division**: Scaling and normalization operations
- **Exponential**: Growth and decay modeling

**Trigonometric Genes:**
- **Sine/Cosine**: Cyclical pattern detection and seasonal analysis
- **Tangent**: Phase relationship analysis

**Custom Genes** (Future Enhancement):
- **Moving Average**: Smoothing and trend identification
- **Fourier Transform**: Frequency domain analysis
- **Regression**: Linear relationship modeling

**Chromosome Architecture**
Each chromosome represents a sequential processing pipeline:
- Genes execute in order, with later genes able to use results from earlier genes
- Multiple chromosomes process the same data in parallel
- Results combine to create comprehensive data analysis

**Organism Composition**
Complete algorithms composed of one or more chromosomes:
- Simple organisms focus on specific analysis tasks
- Complex organisms combine multiple analysis approaches
- Identification system allows tracking organism performance over time

### Evolution Engine

**Seeding Strategy**
The system begins with five carefully designed seed organisms:

1. **Simple Arithmetic**: Basic trend analysis (addition + multiplication)
2. **Trigonometric Analysis**: Cyclical pattern detection (sine + amplification)
3. **Data Transformation**: Parallel additive and multiplicative processing
4. **Reductive Processing**: Multi-stage data refinement
5. **Basic Composite**: Multi-path analysis with varied operations

**Breeding Process**
The BasicOrganismBreeder implements a "chromosome carousel" strategy:
- Parent organisms contribute chromosomes to multiple offspring
- Each child receives a unique combination of parental chromosomes
- Genetic diversity ensures exploration of different algorithmic approaches
- Children receive unique identifiers for performance tracking

**Selection and Evolution** (Future Implementation)
- Organisms compete based on prediction accuracy or analytical effectiveness
- Top performers become parents for the next generation
- Mutation introduces random variations to explore new algorithmic space
- Population management maintains optimal organism diversity

### Repository and Persistence

**Organism Management**
- In-memory storage for development and testing
- Full CRUD operations for organism lifecycle management
- JSON serialization for data exchange and backup
- Extensible to database backends for production deployment

**Experiment Tracking**
- Seeding operations initialize organism populations
- Performance metrics track evolutionary progress
- Historical data enables analysis of algorithmic evolution

## Application Architecture

### REST API Design

Standard REST principles are used to interact with the server and provide data to the UI (future development).

**JSON Output:**
- Pretty-printed formatting for human readability
- Consistent structure across all endpoints
- Type information included for complex polymorphic objects

### Technology Foundation

**Spring Boot Framework:**
- Dependency injection for component management
- RESTful web services for external integration
- Configuration management for deployment flexibility
